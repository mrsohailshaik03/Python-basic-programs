# Aim: To implement DFS and BFS
# Algorithm:
# DFS Algorithm
# The DSF algorithm follows as:
# 1.	We will start by putting any one of the graph's vertex on top of the stack.
# 2.	After that take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list of the vertex.
# 3.	Next, create a list of that adjacent node of the vertex. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list of vertexes to the top of the stack.
# 4.	Lastly, keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
# BFS Algorithm
# The BSF algorithm follows as:
# 1.	 Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
# 2.	 Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
# 3.	 Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
# 4.	 Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.
# Program: -
# Breadth-First Search (BFS)
